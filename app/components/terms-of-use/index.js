    This agreement (these “Terms”) governs the terms under which you may access
    and use the Stacks Wallet software (the “Software”) made available to you by
    Blockstack Public Benefit Corporation (“Blockstack”). By clicking “I
    Accept,” or by downloading, installing, or otherwise accessing or using the
    Software, you agree that you have read and understood, and, as a condition
    to your use of the Software, you agree to be bound by, the following terms
    and conditions.
    <br />
    <br />
    BLOCKSTACK DOES NOT HOLD YOUR KEYS FOR YOU. WE CANNOT ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT OR
    RECOVER YOUR KEYS. IF YOU NEED TO RESTORE YOUR WALLET, YOU MUST ENTER THE
    SEED PHRASE PROVIDED WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW WALLET. YOU ARE SOLELY
    RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFEGUARDING YOUR KEYS AND THE SEED PHRASE.
    <br />
    <br />
    1. Eligibility. The Software is provided to you for the purpose of
    generating a private-public key pair (your “Keys”), or enabling your use of
    a hardware wallet, in order to receive Blockstack tokens (the “Stacks
    Tokens”). In order to be eligible to use the Software, you must be: (i) an
    investor in Stacks Tokens pursuant to a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens
    with Blockstack Token, LLC or pursuant to a purchase agreement for Stacks
    Tokens with Blockstack Token, LLC, or (ii) an investor in Blockstack Token
    Fund AI, L.P. or Blockstack Token Fund QP, L.P.
    <br />
    <br />
    2. License. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these
    Terms, Blockstack grants you, solely for your personal use, a limited,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
    install and use one object code copy of the Software. Except and solely to
    the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may
    not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the
    Software; (b) make modifications to the Software; or (c) interfere with or
    circumvent any feature of the Software, including any security or access
    control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the
    Software, you may not use it.
    <br />
    <br />
    3. Ownership; Proprietary Rights. The Software is owned and operated by
    Blockstack. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation,
    information, data, computer code (including source code or object code),
    products, software, services, and all other elements of the Software
    (“Materials”) provided by Blockstack are protected by intellectual property
    and other laws. All Materials included in the Software are the property of
    Blockstack or its third party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by
    Blockstack, you may not make use of the Materials. Blockstack reserves all
    rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.
    <br />
    <br />
    4. Third Party Terms
    <br />
    <br />
    4.1 Third Party Software and Linked Websites. Blockstack may provide tools
    through the Software that enable you to export information to third party
    services. By using one of these tools, you agree that Blockstack may
    transfer that information to the applicable third party service. Third party
    services are not under Blockstack’s control, and, to the fullest extent
    permitted by law, Blockstack is not responsible for any third party
    service’s use of your exported information. The Software may also contain
    links to third party websites. Linked websites are not under Blockstack’s
    control, and Blockstack is not responsible for their content.
    <br />
    <br />
    4.2 Third Party Software. The Software may include or incorporate third
    party software components that are generally available free of charge under
    licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute
    those components (“Third Party Components”). Although the Software is
    provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents,
    restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third
    Party Components under the applicable third party licenses or to limit your
    use of Third Party Components under those third party licenses.
    <br />
    <br />
    5. Prohibited Conduct. BY USING THE SOFTWARE YOU AGREE NOT TO, OR TO ATTEMPT
    TO OR PERMIT ANY OTHER PERSON TO:
    <br />
    <br />
    a. use the Software for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local,
    state, national, or international law;
    <br />
    <br />
    b. interfere with security-related features of the Software, including by:
    (i) disabling or circumventing features that prevent or limit use or copying
    of any content; or (ii) reverse engineering or otherwise attempting to
    discover the source code of any portion of the Software except to the extent
    that the activity is expressly permitted by applicable law; or
    <br />
    <br />
    c. perform any fraudulent activity including impersonating any person or
    entity, claiming a false affiliation, accessing any other Software account
    without permission.
    <br />
    <br />
    6. Term, Termination and Modification of the Software. These Terms are
    effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install,
    access, or use the Software, and ending when terminated as described in this
    Section. If you violate any provision of these Terms, your authorization to
    access the Software and these Terms automatically terminate. In addition,
    Blockstack may, at its sole discretion, terminate these Terms or suspend or
    terminate your right to access to the Software, at any time for any reason
    or no reason, with or without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
    termination of these Terms or your access to the Software, you will still be
    able to access your Keys and Stacks Tokens. Blockstack reserves the right to
    modify or discontinue the Software at any time (including by limiting or
    discontinuing certain features of the Software), temporarily or permanently,
    without notice to you. Blockstack will have no liability for any change to
    the Software or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of
    the Software.
    <br />
    <br />
    7. Indemnity. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible
    for your use of the Software, and you will defend and indemnify Blockstack
    and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates,
    subsidiaries and agents (together, the “Blockstack Entities”) from and
    against every claim brought by a third party, and any related liability,
    damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs,
    arising out of or connected with: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse
    of, the Software; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any
    representation, warranty, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your
    violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property
    right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or
    (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the
    right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of
    any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting
    your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that
    case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.
    <br />
    <br />
    8. Disclaimers; No Warranties
    <br />
    <br />
    THE SOFTWARE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SOFTWARE
    ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. BLOCKSTACK DISCLAIMS
    ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE
    SOFTWARE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SOFTWARE,
    INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY
    WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. BLOCKSTACK DOES
    NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY
    MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
    SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND
    BLOCKSTACK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
    ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE
    SOFTWARE OR BLOCKSTACK ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE
    THROUGH THE SOFTWARE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE
    BLOCKSTACK ENTITIES OR THE SOFTWARE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE
    TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE
    SOFTWARE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING AND SAFEGUARDING YOUR
    KEYS AND SEED PHRASE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF
    THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT
    RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM
    OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA,
    INCLUDING STACKS TOKENS.
    <br />
    <br />
    THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE
    FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Blockstack does not disclaim any warranty
    or other right that Blockstack is prohibited from disclaiming under
    applicable law.
    <br />
    <br />
    9. Limitation of Liability
    <br />
    <br />
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE BLOCKSTACK
    ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
    GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR
    ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SOFTWARE, YOUR
    KEYS, STACKS TOKENS, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER
    BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY
    OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY BLOCKSTACK ENTITY HAS BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.
    <br />
    <br />
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE
    BLOCKSTACK ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
    USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE
    UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO
    $100.
    <br />
    <br />
    EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,
    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES
    ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS
    AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH
    OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF
    THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY
    LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
    <br />
    <br />
    10. Miscellaneous. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights
    under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
    without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time
    without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any
    provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time
    after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms,
    or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or
    default or a waiver of the provision itself. If any part of these Terms is
    held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given
    effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain
    in full force and effect. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State
    of New York without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Blockstack
    submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and
    federal courts located within New York County, New York for resolution of
    any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We are under no
    obligation to provide support for the Software. In instances where we may
    offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.
